# Overview
This is a verilog HDL core for a 5G NR lower Phy receiver. It is optimized for low ressource usage so that it can run on a [PlutoSDR](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/adalm-pluto.html), which has a XilinxÂ® Zynq Z-7010 with only 80 DSP slices and 28K logic cells. Since this design is optimized for low ressource usage, it can only demodulate at 3.84 MSPS which is equal to 256 point FFT or 20 RBs (Ressource Blocks). A ressource block in 5G consists of 12 subcarriers. The 256 point FFT contains only 20*12=240 usable subcarriers, because at each edge of the spectrum there are 8 zero carriers.<br>
Cell search is limited to 1 frequency offset range. Within this frequency offset range, the PSS correlator works up to a CFO of about += 10 kHz.
Each PSS correlator only detects one of the possible three different PSS sequences. If a general cell search for all 3 possible N_id_2's is needed, 3 PSS correlators need to be instanciated in parallel. If CFOs larger than the detection range of the PSS correlator are expected, the different CFO possibilities can be tried sequentially by configuring the receiver via its AXI-lite interface.<br>

Implemented so far:<br>
* Decimator (detailed description below)
* PSS correlator (detailed description below)
* Peak detector (detailed description below)
* FFT demodulator (detailed description below)
* SSS detector (detailed description below)
* Frame sync (detailed description below)
* Channel estimator (detailed description below)

<b>Disclaimer: It is unlikely that this design which is optimized for mobility and low ressource usage will implement all possible 5G NR Phy features in hdl. It is instead intended to use this as a basis for experiments with mobile data links that are '5G like' i.e. for UAV communication. In a later stage a generic 'Ressource Grid Subscriber' core can be implemented, which sends user selectable OFDM symbols via AXI-DMA to the A9 core. This can then be used to implement full 5G functionality on the CPU, or at least the reduced capability (RedCap) subset which is defined in 5G NR Release 17. A nice project would also be to interface this lower Phy to the higher Phy and MAC from the [srsRAN Project](https://github.com/srsran/srsRAN_Project).</b>

# Tests
Testbenches are written in Python using cocotb. For simulation both iverilog and Verilator are used. Iverilog is used for short tests whereas Verilator is used for tests with larger data throughput.
<br>
To install the necessary requirements for running the tests do (assuming You start in the dir where this repo is cloned):
```
  cd ..
  sudo apt install iverilog
  pip install -e requirements.txt
  git clone https://github.com/catkira/cocotb.git
  cd cocotb && pip install -e . && cd ..
  git clone https://github.com/verilator/verilator.git
  cd verilator
  git reset v5.006
  ./configure
  make -j$(nproc) && sudo make install
  cd ..
  cd open5G_rx
```
Then to run all tests do:
```
  pytest --workers $(nproc)
```
If You only want to run a simulation of the receiver do:
```
  pytest --workers $(nproc) tests/test_receiver.py
```
The following diagram shows the plots that test_receiver.py generates with 2300 Hz simulated CFO. The first plot shows the uncorrected IQ constellation plot for a PBCH packet which consists of 3 OFDM symbols. The second diagram shows the CFO corrected IQ constellation plot, red dots are from the first SSB, green dots are from the second SSB. The second SSB is received 20 ms after the first SSB and might contain a better CFO correction, because CFO correction improves itself iteratively up to a certain point. The third diagram shows the CFO and channel corrected IQ constellation of a PBCH packet. The red dots are from the first symbol, green dots from the second symbol and blue dots from the third symbol.

# Decimator
The incoming sample rate to the SSB_sync module should be 3.84 MSPS. This sample rate is then internally decimated to 1.92 MSPS so that the PSS and SSS detection cores can run most efficiently.
The PBCH demodulation core needs 3.84 MSPS. Decimation is done by [this](https://github.com/catkira/CIC) CIC core which does not need any multiplications.

# PSS correlator
Without optimizations the PSS correlator would require 128 * 3 real multipliers, 3 real multipliers for each complex multiplication. The absolute value is calculated by an approximation and does not use any multipliers. This can be further optimized by taking into account that the PSS sequence in time domain is real valued. Therefore the PSS sequence in frequency domain is complex conjugate centrally symmetric. This can be used to reduce the required number of real multipliers to 128 * 2 + 2 as shown in [this](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8641097) paper. <br>
Further optimization can be achieved when taking into account that the sample rate for the SSB is only 3.84 MSPS (with 15 KHz SCS) and the PSS and SSB detection cores only need a sample rate of 1.92 MSPS. If the PSS correlator runs on a 122.88 Mhz clock, a single multiplier can be used to perform 64 multiplications at 1.92 MSPS. This feature is already implemented into the PSS correlator (PSS_correlator_mr.v) and can be adjusted by changing the MULT_REUSE parameter. <br>
For a sample rate of 1.92 MSPS and a clock rate of 122.88 MHz, the PSS correlator requires 2 * 2 real multipliers. <br><br>
The PSS correlator core supports variable widths for the data input (IN_DW), for the PSS coefficients (TAP_DW) and for the output (OUT_DW). The bit growth from input to output can be described as IN_DW / 2 + TAP_DW / 2 + 1 + ceil(log2(PSS_LEN)). If OUT_DW is not large enough to receive the whole bit growth, the output will be truncated so that only some LSBs get lost. However, in that case there will be unnecessary many ressources used, therefore it is recommended to configure the core in such a way that no truncation is needed. Since IN_DW and TAP_DW are widths for complex numbers, they have to be even numbers so that the real and imaginary part can have equal widths. <br>
A reasonable configuration would be: <br>
   IN_DW = 32 (signed I and Q) <br>
   TAP_DW = 32 (signed I and Q) <br>
   OUT_DW = 48 (unsigned) <br>
Calculation the growth gives: 16 + 16 + 1 + 7 = 40 <br>
This would allow DSP48E1 slices to be used, even for the last multipliers that are used to calculate the absolute value.

<b>TODO:</b> pipelining

# Peak detector
The peak detector takes the sum of the last WINDOW_LEN samples and compares it to the current sample. If the current sample is larger than the window sum times a DETECTION_FACTOR, then a peak is detected. DETECTION_FACTOR is currently hard coded to 16, so that the multiplication can be implemented as a shift operation. As result, this core only needs WINDOW_LEN additions and no multiplications. <br><br>
<b>TODO:</b> There is currently no pipelining implemented. For larger windows it is probably needed to break up the add operation into different stages.

# FFT demodulator
The FFT demodulator uses [this](https://github.com/catkira/FFT) FFT core. Since the core runs at 122.88 MHz while the sample rate it only 3.84 MSPS, overclocking can be used to reduce the number of required multipliers. Normally a FFT would need 3 real multipliers per stage, with overclocking this can be reduced to 1 multiplier per stage. SSS would only need a 128 point FFT, but a 256 point FFT is used anyway, so that it can also be used for PBCH demodulation. This results in 8 real multipliers required for the FFT. The FFT demodulator is synchronized to the start signal from the Peak detector. It then continuously performs FFTs. There are special tag signals for the start of the SSS and PBCH symbols. Zero carriers are removed from the output, so that each FFT outputs 240 subcarriers. The cyclic prefix advance is configurable. The ideal cyclic prefix advance to prevent ISI (inter symbol interference) is half a cyclic prefix length.

# SSS demodulator
The SSS detector currently operates in search mode, which means that it compares the received SSS sequence to all possible 335 SSS for the given N_id_1 which comes from the PSS detection.
The code is optimized to not use any multiplication and no large additions. This is achieved by doing every operation in a separate clock cycle. This means the core needs about 335 * 127 = 42545 cycles to finish the detection, assuming the system clock is 100 MHz, that would be 425 us.
The code is also memory optimized, by only storing the two m-sequences that are needed to construct all the possible SSS. It currently builds the stored m-sequences at startup using [this](https://github.com/catkira/LFSR) LFSR core. The code could be modified to have the m-sequences statically stored.

# Frame sync
This core keeps track of the current frame, subframe, slot and symbol number and controls the PSS detector. The 10 bit system frame number (SFN) whichs is contained in the BCH message needs to be sent to this core via AXI.
![Frame structure diagram](doc/frame_structure.jpg)
This core currently only supports 15 kHz SCS (subcarrier spacing) and the frame structure shown in the diagram above.
It also controls the PSS detector by sending it to sleep for 20 ms after a SSB was detected.
This core also sends the sync signals like SSB_start to the FFT_demod core. The FFT_demod core needs this timing information to generate timing information like SSS_valid and symbol_type information in its tuser output.
<br>
TODO: output frame, subframe and symbol number together with SSB_start and CP length of current symbol in tuser.

# Channel estimator
The channel estimator currently only corrects the phase angles, this is enough for BPSK and QPSK demodulation. It also detects the PBCH DMRS (DeModulation Reference Sequence) by comparing the incoming pilots with the 8 possible ibar_SSB configurations. The detected ibar_SSB is then send to the frame_sync core which uses this signal to align itself to the right subframe number.
